# Automatic_Voice_Assisted_Wheelchair
These wheelchairs incorporate  voice recognition and intelligent control systems to enable users to navigate their environment, communicate  commands, and perform various tasks using their voice.
Automatic Voice-assisted wheelchairs are technologically advanced mobility devices designed to provide independent mobility to individuals with physical disabilities or limited mobility. These wheelchairs incorporate 
voice recognition and intelligent control systems to enable users to navigate their environment, communicate commands, and perform various tasks using their voice. 
This project aims to explore the design, development, and functionality of voice-assisted automatic wheelchairs. The wheelchair utilizes a combination of hardware and software components to create a user-friendly and efficient 
mobility solution. The wheelchair's primary objective is to enhance the user's quality of life by increasing their autonomy, promoting social interactions, and improving accessibility.
